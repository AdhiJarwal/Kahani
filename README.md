# Kahani
Kahani is an android app for watching and reading stories in the Hindi language. This app is specially developed for kids so it’s very easy to use. This app provides different types of stories from different categories like Adventure, Mythology, Fiction, Panchtantra, Fairly Tale, Mystery, etc  As we believed that Stories create magic and a sense of wonder in the world. Stories teach us about life, about ourselves, and about others. Children have an innate love of stories. Storytelling can teach children to become more thoughtful towards individuals and develops an emotional quotient and empathy. You can directly download the App by dowloading the कहानि.APK uploaded above. 07-03-2022 is the end date of this project.
